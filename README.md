# SimulatorML

This simulator provides an interactive introduction to essential machine learning concepts. Built with vanilla JS and HTML/CSS, it includes modules on data exploration, training, neural networks, classification, and real-world applications. All features work directly in the browser—no setup or backend required.​

Features
Dashboard: Track your progress through interactive ML learning modules.

What is ML?: Easy introduction contrasting ML with traditional programming.

Data Playground: Explore a dataset, compute statistics, and visualize data.

Training Simulator: Add points, train a regression model, and watch parameter updates.

Neural Network Visualizer: Adjust architecture and activation functions, view forward passes.

Classification Demo: Create and separate classes, watch the perceptron learn the decision boundary.

Real-World Applications: Sentiment analysis, predictions, plus practical ML examples.​

Installation
