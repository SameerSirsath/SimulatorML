# Interactive Machine Learning Simulator

This simulator provides an interactive introduction to essential machine learning concepts.  
Built with **vanilla JS** and **HTML/CSS**, it includes modules on data exploration, training, neural networks, classification, and real-world applications.  
All features work directly in the browser — **no setup or backend required**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dashboard**: Track your progress through interactive ML learning modules  
- **What is ML?**: Easy introduction contrasting ML with traditional programming  
- **Data Playground**: Explore a dataset, compute statistics, and visualize data  
- **Training Simulator**: Add points, train a regression model, and watch parameter updates  
- **Neural Network Visualizer**: Adjust architecture and activation functions, view forward passes  
- **Classification Demo**: Create and separate classes, watch the perceptron learn the decision boundary  
- **Real-World Applications**: Sentiment analysis, predictions, plus practical ML examples
